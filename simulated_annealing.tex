\label{sec:simulated-annealing}

Simulated Annealing~\cite{kirkpatrick} is a generic probabilistic algorithm for
finding the global optimum of a given function,
$\mathcal{F}:\mathcal{R}\rightarrow\mathcal{R}$, which has a large search space.
Simulated Annealing in most of the cases is cheaper than exhaustive enumeration,
which is exhaustively listing the entire search space. Since it is a monte carlo
method it will always terminate and the solution need not be the most optimal
but in general considered to be a good approximation of the optimum.

In general SA is a non-greedy heuristic algorithm which
